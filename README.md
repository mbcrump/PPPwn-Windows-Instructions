# PPPwn - PlayStation 4 PPPoE RCE - Windows 10/11 Instructions

Learn how to use PPPwn on Windows 10/11 without installing Virtualbox or using WSL (Windows Subsystem For Linux).

# What is it?

PPPwn is a kernel remote code execution exploit for PlayStation 4 developed by The Flow. It works up to firmware 11.00. The official repo is maintained here : https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/PPPwn

Supported PS4 versions are:
- FW 9.00
- FW 9.03/9.04
- FW 9.50 / 9.60
- FW 10.00/10.01
- FW 10.50 / 10.70 / 10.71
- FW 11.00

## Homebrew Status

These instructions will enable GoldHen on 9.00 only right now.  You can also follow the project by [LM](https://github.com/LightningMods/PPPwn). 

## Requirements

In order to get started, you'll need the following items. Make sure to install all the applications listed before proceeding.

- Computer with Ethernet port (USB adapter also works)
- Ethernet cable connected to your PC/PS4
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- [NPCap 1.79](https://npcap.com/#download)

## Usage

1. On your computer, navigate to a folder where you'd like to store the exploit. 

  Now clone the repository:
  
  ```sh
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/PPPwn
  ```

2. Install the requirements:

  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

3. Download the  `PPPwn.rar` from [here](https://github.com/mbcrump/PPPwn-Windows-Instructions/blob/main/compiled-binaries/PPPwn.rar) site and copy the `stage1` and `stage2` folder to where you installed the exploit overwritting any files.

4. Inside the `PPPwn.rar`, you'll find a `usb` directory followed by a `payload.bin` file. Copy the `payload.bin` file to a USB Drive and insert it into your PS4. Note this is only for 9.00. 

5. Run the exploit:

  ```sh
  python3 pppwn.py --interface=Ethernet --fw=900
  ```

For other firmwares, e.g. FW 9.03, pass `--fw=903`.

6. On your PS4:

  - Go to `Settings` and then `Network`
  - Select `Set Up Internet connection` and choose `Use a LAN Cable`
  - Choose `Custom` setup and choose `PPPoE` for `IP Address Settings`
  - Enter anything for `PPPoE User ID` and `PPPoE Password`
  - Choose `Automatic` for `DNS Settings` and `MTU Settings`
  - Choose `Do Not Use` for `Proxy Server`
  - Click `Test Internet Connection` to communicate with your computer

If the exploit fails or the PS4 crashes, you can skip the internet setup and simply click on `Test Internet Connection`. If the `pppwn.py` script is stuck waiting for a request/response, abort it and run it again on your computer, and then click on `Test Internet Connection` on your PS4.

If the exploit works, you should see an output similar to below, and you should see `Cannot connect to network.` followed by `PPPwned` printed on your PS4.
